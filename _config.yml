bio: "I'm Zander, a front-end developer from London. I work at [TMW](//tmwunlimited.com) as a Creative Technology Lead. When I'm not working there I can usually be found hacking on [Kickoff](//trykickoff.com) or other open source projects as [on Github](//github.com/mrmartineau). Read [some articles](/#articles) or get in contact with me in any of the usual ways; it'd be great to hear from you."
