			<p>Kickoff is an open-source front-end framework that I co-created and maintain. It has been a major focus of mine for the past four years while working at <a href="http://tmwunlimited.com">TMW</a>. Rather than be all things to all people, we have endeavored to focus on ensuring the framework is as robust and helpful so that developers at the agency, and beyond, can focus on what matters most â€” making awesome websites!</p>
