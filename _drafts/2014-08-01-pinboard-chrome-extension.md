I love [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in), in fact I think I may be a little obsessed with this simple bookmarking service, but I think its UI leaves a lot to be desired. Some say that it is already perfect and no improvements are needed, I am not one of those people.

I created a Chrome extension that cleans up the UI, improves the visual hierarchy & the UX.

* Typography was improved by increasing the font-size & by using [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) which makes everything much more clear and readable.
* The UI is now fluid and a few responsive touches have been added so that it made better use of the available screen space.
* Tags and bundles are now much more defined
* The colour scheme was muted slightly and the header
* Stars are larger and clearer

Re-styling Pinboard was not without challenges though, the HTML markup Pinboard uses hardly has any classes or IDs, this meant that it was quite difficult to target certain elements when I needed to.

Pinboard has always just worked, it is a simple app that does one thing very well & having investigated the code I can see and appreciate the reasons behind the reluctance to update because it does not break anywhere.

### Download it
Head to the Chrome Web Store to [download the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinboard-style/mmcabafimbenknlnlndkdfjgfkkljhmg?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon). I would love some feedback because I know there's a lot that could be improved. I have not finished work on this either, so my default response might be that I am already working on it...

This marks my first foray into developing Chrome extensions and I hope to make more in the future.
