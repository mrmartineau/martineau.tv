Lynx is currently (Jan 2013) running a worldwide competition to send someone into space - the entrant with the most votes wins - they asked TMW to create a microsite to help entrants promote themselves and garner more votes.

We built a responsive, single-page app that allows entrants to create and share a poster or choose from one of many prewritten status messages. The site is interesting because it positions the user in space and changes the viewport on each sub-page. As well as being project lead, I created the moving page navigation element and the more complex responsive features.
