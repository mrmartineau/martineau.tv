Shift 4 are a broadcast facility company for film and TV in the UK. NEVERBLAND were asked to revamp and extend their existing site. We added a full equipment listing, with wishlist (think shopping list) feature; a blog and various other sections that overall helped customers engage with the company.

I designed & developed the front-end for this project making it fully responsive & adaptable to any device that uses it.
