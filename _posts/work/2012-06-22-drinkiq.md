This app, developed for [DrinkIQ](http://drinkiq.com), determines how many calories and
units of alcohol you might have consumed.

It is a fully responsive site that features two very different layouts
at each of the main breakpoints. Javascript templating by [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
is used to populate the site's content.
