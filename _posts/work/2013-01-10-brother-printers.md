Brother Printers asked TMW to create a microsite for the various printer ranges. Each page of this site is devoted to one range and uses campaign assets to give a more consistent look and feel across media.

I worked closely with the designer, Dawn Jenner, to create an engaging and appealing experience that promoted each product's features and enabled customers to make a more informed decision.
