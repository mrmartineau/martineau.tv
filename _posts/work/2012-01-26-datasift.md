DataSift is the leading platform for building applications with insights derived from the most popular social networks and news sources. NEVERBLAND were asked to create a WYSIWYG editor for customers to more easily create 'streams' within their system.

I designed a huge library of icons and the UI for the WYSIWYG editor itself. I left NEVERBLAND half-way through this project so what you see now is an updated version of the work that I did.
I developed a simple, hiDPI ready, site as a counterpart to their desktop site that focused on performance and usability.
