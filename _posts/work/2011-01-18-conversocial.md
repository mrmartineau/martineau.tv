Conversocial is a Social Media management app for marketers and brands. NEVERBLAND were asked to redesign & develop their existing website. What
you see below is my design for their home page, which unfortunately, was never used, however, many aspects were used in the final site.
Conversocial have since redesigned their homepage so NEVERBLAND's version can be seen [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110705083639/http://www.conversocial.com/).
