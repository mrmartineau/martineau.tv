My wife uses a simple version of a Cloze test when she teaches; she creates these tests using Word & a lot of copying & pasting. When she saw my [Quick & Dirty Cloze test with Lettering.js]() she asked if I could make a dedicated close test for her so I set about creating a basic webapp so that she could speed up this mundane task.

## Behold the Cloze creator
Try it out yourself at [martineau.tv/cloze/](http://martineau.tv/cloze/) & if you think it can be improved, I welcome your suggestions.

Also, I should thank a kind [Stack Overflow user](http://stackoverflow.com/users/546272/andy) for giving me a hand creating this.
