It has been a long time since I have written about Sublime Text & the benefits it provides me as a front-end developer. Its packages are one of the main reasons I haven't changed my text editor/IDE in over 3 years. I even created [a wiki](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetupWiki/wiki/) (of sorts) to help users get up and running with the app and choosing the right packages for a given task. This post will only focus on the packages that I believe most users should be using for front-end development.

### [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
Before you install any other packages, make sure you install Package Control first. It makes installing and keeping packages up-to-date really simple.

## For writing code
### [Emmet](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet)
Emmet (previously known as Zen Coding) is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. Find out more at http://emmet.io

Interactive code linting framework for Sublime Text 3. Installation instructions can be found at [here](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) and each language needs its own plugin, see a list [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/search/sublimelinter).

### [jQuery](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/jQuery)
This package provides snippets for most of jQuery's methods making the API even easier to use.

### [Inc-Dec-Value](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Inc-Dec-Value)
Increase / decrease numbers (integer and fractional), dates, hex color values, opposite relations or cycled enumerations on the configured value & a bonus - string actions (upper, lower, capitalize). See my extended settings [here](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeText3UserSettings/blob/master/inc_dec_value.sublime-settings).

### [ColorHighlighter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Color%20Highlighter)
ColorHighlighter is a plugin for the Sublime text 2 and 3, which underlays selected hexadecimal colorcodes (like “#FFFFFF”, “rgb(255,255,255)”, “white”, etc.) with their real color. Also, plugin adds color picker to easily modify colors.

### [Convert case](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Case%20Conversion)
It converts the current word/token between pascal,
camel, snake, dot, dash (hyphen) cases, and separated words.

### [BracketHighlighter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/BracketHighlighter)

### [MultiEditUtils](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/MultiEditUtils)

### [Soda Theme](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Theme%20-%20Soda)
Dark and light custom UI themes for Sublime Text. I use the dark version, it is my preferred UI theme. A list of other themes can be found [here](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetupWiki/wiki/Interface-Themes)

### [Themr](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Themr)
A UI theme selector for Sublime Text.

### [ColorSchemeSelector](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ColorSchemeSelector)
Sublime Text Plugin to select theme quickly via the Quick Panel.

### [Base16 Color Schemes](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Base16%20Color%20Schemes)

### [TabsExtra](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/TabsExtra)

## For specific syntaxes

### [JavaScriptNext](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/JavaScriptNext%20-%20ES6%20Syntax)
This is an improved syntax package for Javascript. It builds on the language files commonly used and adds more fine grained matching and also includes new features from ECMAScript 6 like modules, succinct methods, arrow functions, classes, generators, and accessors (ES5).

If you want to use it for every js file, create or open a javascript file, then you need to click the syntax name in the bottom right corner of Sublime, then click 'Open all with current extension as', then select JavascriptNext - ES6 > JavascriptNext.

### [Liquid](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Liquid)
Liquid Templates in Sublime. Useful if you develop Jekyll sites.

## For general help

### [FindKeyConflicts](https://sublime.wbond.net/search/FindKeyConflicts)
Plugin for Sublime Text to help identify conflicting key mappings.


## For lolz

### [Sound](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Sound)
This adds sound effects to many actions in Sublime. Could be a good prank to install it on a fellow developer's machine.

## Want to change some settings?
Sublime's default setup is great but almost every part of it can be modified to your taste. Please have a look at [my own settings and preferences](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeText3UserSettings) to see what is possible.
