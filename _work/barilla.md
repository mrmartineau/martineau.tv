Barilla, the world's most successful Pasta company, came to TMW to update all their local brand websites. Barilla operates in 30+ markets and needed a solution that would fit for each.

I worked in tight collaboration with the UX and design teams to create a consistent, accessible and performant website that enabled consumers to find what they needed quickly.

This project used a styleguide-driven development workflow with modular components. The styleguide is a project in and of itself and serves as documentation and a living reference for all the modules and templates that are used on the site (Kickoff's [Statix](http://trykickoff.com/learn/statix) made this job much more easy). View styleguide at its temporary home [here](barilla-static-ci.tmwtest.co.uk).

From a technical perspective, all the Javascript was ES2015 compatible using Babel to transpile through the Browserify bundler. Many NPM modules were used to ensure maximum efficiency (so far, no issues with #unpublishgate). The ES2015 was ported to version 7 of [Kickoff](http://trykickoff.com). Teamcity was used to build/compile all client-side assets at each deployment.

We soft-launch to the US market in March 2016 with more locales being rolled out in the months following. We are actively developing new features and the site is constantly improving.
