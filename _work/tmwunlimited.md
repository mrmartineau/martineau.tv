Revamping your own agency's website, the project that everyone seems to shy away from, not me though. I knew that something special could be achieved if it was handled correctly. Thankfully, Lorena, our wonderful designer, and I were given full autonomy to produce our agency's new website.

With the 'simple' task of making it better than the last site, we interviewed the many stakeholders to try and understand what the site needed to convey, then reworked the architecture and finally translated that into a unique and timeless design. Through many iterations and refinements, we landed upon what you see now: the first phase of what proves to be a constantly evolving, and flexible platform for the business to show how we operate.
