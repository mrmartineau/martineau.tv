Colette is a department store based in Paris. NEVERBLAND were asked to pitch for a redesign of their existing ecommerce offering.

I produced this design for the home page, you can see three states: normal, navigation hovered and page content hovered. Unfortunately our ideas were not chosen and at time of writing, Colette still have not redesigned their site.
