Novalux's visual identity helped form the basis for their website design. I also designed the site and developed it using the ExpressionEngine CMS. It makes use of some great web fonts, it is set in [Proxima Nova](http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html) and [Clarendon](http://fontdeck.com/font/clarendonurw/light).
