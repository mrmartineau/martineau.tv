Novalux Energy Solutions are experts in providing renewable and cost-effective energy solutions to businesses across the world. I was given the task of creating their visual identity and the design and development of their corporate website.

Typography on the site is set in [Proxima Nova](http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html) and [Clarendon](http://fontdeck.com/font/clarendonurw/light) and it was developed using the ExpressionEngine CMS.
