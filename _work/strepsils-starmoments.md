Strepsils sooth your throat and allow you to keep your voice in tip top condition- thats why they make a perfect partner for The X Factor, and all of it’s dubious talents.

We were tasked with digitally dramatising the partnership between Strepsils and The X Factor, giving away hundreds of X Factor Final tickets, whilst creating something fun and engaging.

The outcome was **Strepsils Star Moments**, a responsive, mobile optimised website that hosts a competition. The competition challenges X Factor fans to find the moment in a classic X Factor performance where the contestants voice sounds at it’s absolute best. The closer they are to Mr T’s (Strepsils oddly named mascot) chosen time, the more likely they are to win tickets.
