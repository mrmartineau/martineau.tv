Built on Jekyll, and using Kickoff, this is a very simple, re-skinned site for TMW's tech team. Previously the site was just a blog, but now I have included some newer sections that take advantage of Jekyll v2's new features: data files and collections.

Having multiple authors presented some unique problems - as it is not supported in Jekyll - so some creative coding was needed in order to just pull the author data onto the page..
