title: "I'm Zander, a front-end developer from London. I work at [TMW](//tmwunlimited.com) as a Creative Technology Lead. When I'm not working there I can usually be found hacking on [Kickoff](//trykickoff.com) or other open source projects as [on Github](//github.com/mrmartineau). Read [some articles](/#articles) or get in contact with me in any of the usual ways; it'd be great to hear from you."

			<p>Kickoff is an open-source front-end framework that I co-created and maintain. It has been a major focus of mine for the past four years while working at <a href="http://tmwunlimited.com">TMW</a>. Rather than be all things to all people, we have endeavored to focus on ensuring the framework is as robust and helpful so that developers at the agency, and beyond, can focus on what matters most â€” making awesome websites!</p>
